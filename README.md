# Neuters - Reuters Redirect

This is an alternative frontend to [Reuters](https://reuters.com/). It is intented to be lightweight and fast and was heavily inspired by [Nitter](https://nitter.net/).

A sample is hosted on [neuters.de](https://neuters.de/)

* No JavaScript or ads
* No tracking
* No cookies
* Lightweight (usually <10KiB vs 50MiB from Reuters)
* Dynamic Theming (respects system theme)

This is a work in progress. Please report any bugs or suggestions [above](https://github.com/HookedBehemoth/supreme-waffle/issues).
